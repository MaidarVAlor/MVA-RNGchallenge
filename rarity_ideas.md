# rarity ideas guidelines
## 3 pillars
1. all rarities and their chances are set in 2<sup>x</sup> steps (example: 2<sup>8</sup> is 256, 2<sup>10</sup> is 1024...) and this is **NOT GOING** to change
2. the first 18 rarity chances are claimed, there are no things like 2<sup>1.5</sup>
3. no inappropriate names (obviously)

## rules
1. the rarity that gets it's defined rarity chance earlier than others with same value is going to be implemented **FIRST**, the rest can reopen their issues and change the rarity value.
2. I might consider adding "sub-rarities" of rarities if you explain them in a way I can understand implementing it.
3. no begging for implementation just because you said something like "I took so much effort pls pls pls use my rarity pls". read rule 1 of this section.
