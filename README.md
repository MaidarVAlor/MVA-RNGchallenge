# Mahvay's RNG Challenge
### welcome!
made by Mahvay (or "Mva" if you like the shorter word), welcome to this pack's GitHub page.

the RNG Challenge is a simple game in which you press ENTER button and it outputs a random value.
lower output values might appear frequently while higher values might appear rarely.

### features
well... what I can say except you can press the ENTER button and hope to roll a high value?

## trivia
1. this game is the product that came out of my boredom. I just randomly thought of making something in python then found some inspirations and started making that spaghetti code.
2. I made this at 1:00 AM. where I live, most of people sleep but I decided to take this time and do this instead.
